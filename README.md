# Narrative:      
You play as Seven, who is escapee from a top secret research facility. The facility studies objects of power and Seven happens to be one of them. Objects of power or OOPs happen to possess unexplainable properties. One of the facilities subjects has opened a gateway to a mysterious red dimension. So Seven takes this crisis as an oppotunity to escape the facility.

- The player movement and shooting mechnic is very responsive.
  - Custom collision
  - Custom player physics
- Controller Support
- The game stylistically unique and interesting.
  - 2.5D
  - PBR Materials
  - Volumetric Lighting
  - Animations are well intergrated
  - Cohesive art style throughout
- Sound systems such and randomized pitch for bullets and randomized sampling of sound clips for sound steps.
- My own recorded voice over

# What I should be improve
- I did not meet all the specifications pointed in the asignment.
  - I focused on the quality of the features I implemented maybe a little too much which hinder on progress of the overall game.
- Custom collision is not as robust as I woul like it to be. Their is occasional cases where the player would just fall through the game map.
- Not enough levels and the level provided is too short and uninterating.
- Their is some bugs with the UI Text rendering when the depth buffer has a piece of geometry is too close to the camera frustrun.
- The game doesnt flesh out it's story as much as I would of liked it to.
- The game feels like a demo more than a complete game.
